# Wavelet Energies Correlation Screening (WECS)

## Rodney Fonseca, Rogério Negri, Aluísio Pinheiro, Abdourrahmane Atto

This project has the codes and figures of the paper [Wavelet Spatio-Temporal Change Detection on Multitemporal SAR Images](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10105998). WECS can be used to detect changes in time series of images. The time series can have more than two images and the implementation basically needs a bi-dimensional wavelet transform and a measure of correlation.

The folder 'codes' has Matlab implementations that reproduce the simulation study in the paper.
