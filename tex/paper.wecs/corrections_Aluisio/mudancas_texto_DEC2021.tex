************************************ IDEIA DE REGRESSAO *****************

Na página 3 coluna 1 o antepenúltimo parágrafo se lê " Define a mapping of {\it relevant} indices ... as ${\mathcal M}_* ...$ where ... in the images".

Aqui, acrescenta-se


"If we apply to Equation (2) the index dicothomy defined by ${\mathcal M}_*$, we have
\begin{equation}
d(m)=\sum_{(k,l)\in\mathcal M_*}\beta_{k,l}D_{k,l}^{(m)}+\varepilon(m), \label{Regressao}
\end{equation}
where $\beta_{k,l}$ are non-null regression coefficients for $(k,l)\in\mathcal M_*$, and $\varepilon(m)$ are stochastic error terms. 

The error terms allow for both the apportionment of spurious correlation for indices $notin \mathcal M_*$ as well as for the energies not represented by the wavelet smoothing.

It is a well-known property of discrete wavelet transforms that it statistically decorrelates the original data [19,]-[20]. For instance, this motivates the use of WECS instead of ECS or TAAD, since wavelets will result in sparser representations for $\mathcal M_*$ against either method. Moreover, the sure screening theoretical results for independent data motivates our conjecture that the regression set-up given by Equation (\ref{Regressao}) should have a good performance. A rigorous proof for dependent data sets such as multitemporal series of satellite images is beyond the scope of this manuscript, but the numerical results provide us with some solid evidences."
